                An Interactive Blog/Discussion On Performativity

            <p>How can you tell what groups people are a part of? How can others tell what group you are a part of? Every person makes performative decisions about how to or how to not display the groups they are a part of and the unique attributes of their social identity. A lot of people like to customize in order to show what groups they are a part of. You’ve certainly been near cars that have political bumper sticker. Sometimes, you even see people who say a bit too much about themselves through their bumper stickers.</p>
            <p>The ability to encode your identity into symbols is very important for sub-cultures, as it is used to locate other people who share the same sub-culture as you. For instance, within gay communities a code based on the color and pocket that handkerchiefs were kept in served multiple purposes (Wikipedia, 2021b). First, it would help other people within the gay community identify them, despite the lack of general acceptance at the time it emerged (approx. 1970) (Wikipedia, 2021b). Second, it would denote their more specific sexual preferences in order to help match them with someone with compatible wants (Wikipedia, 2021). This is of course no longer as necessary due to the development of social media and changes in societal acceptance.</p>
            <p>Similarly, within swinger culture esoteric symbols are often used to identify individuals. Some things claimed to be symbols include pineapples, a black ring on your right hand, white landscaping rock and pink or purple house decorations, and many more (Richardson, 2017). </p>
            <p>Within punk culture, there is, or was, a code based on the color of your laces on Doc Martens. Wearing your Doc Martens with laces tied in ladder pattern was a common indicator of being a member of the punk community, but divides within the punk community led to the development of color related codes (Inside Fullerton, 2020). Within Nazi and White supremacist punk communities red and white laces were often used to identify members, sometimes only being earned after attacking non-white individuals (Inside Fullerton, 2020). Because of this, yellow laces (one of the factory lace colors) became associated with anti-racist punks, Purple are used for gay pride, and Blue are used for cop killer (another surprisingly extremely definition color) (Inside Fullerton, 2020). Black laces are viewed as being neutral due to being another factory color (Inside Fullerton, 2020). This practice is somewhat dying off, as people are often uninitiated in the code or just want a specific color of laces. </p>
            <p>While these are all very specific examples, there are more general ways people show performativity within their groups, and not all of it is constrained to fashion or customization of personal belongings. Within the Alcoholics Anonymous community, the term “friend(s) of Bill W.” is used to denote membership, as it is referring to the founder of AA (Talcherkar, 2021). These examples are of what is sometimes called a Shibboleth, which is a “custom or tradition, usually a choice of phrasing or even a single word, that distinguishes one group of people from another” (Wikipedia, 2021a). The advantage behind using one in this case being that they can maintain anonymity, thus they can still pass as an individual who is not a member of AA.</p>
            <p>One of the least subtle and most common examples of performativity is t-shirts. The amount of different t-shirts that are made is staggering, and a surprising amount of them say a lot about the wearer. A band shirt can denote the types of music that someone enjoys, as well as music-related subcultures they like to be a part of. A lot of people will wear t-shirts with specific videogames referenced on them, which can display what videogames they like to other gamers. You might wear something referencing the type of car you have, your favorite movies or tv shows, or other hobbies you enjoy.</p>
            <p>Now let’s seriously reflect on the question I asked at start. Do you have any symbols on or around you that show what groups and cultures you are a part of? Maybe you have a phone case with branding on it. Maybe you have shoes that are a part of a subculture (i.e. skating). Do you do anything that symbolizes the groups you are a part of? Maybe you have an uncommon accent. What attributes can be used to uniquely identify you and the groups you are a part of? Can others mislead people?</p>
            <p>Here is my take on answering some of these questions: I’m currently wearing a t-shirt with a “Ghostbusters” reference on it, I have a model of a car on my desk that is known for being in street-racing anime, and a lot more that can identify me. I often wear cargo pants because I work on things like restoring and repairing cars, where thicker fabric can be beneficial. This could also be easily associated with social class and careers in people’s lives. I have a Swiss-army knife, which is commonly associated with being a scout. The mouse, mouse pad, and headset I’m using are gaming accessories, which would make it extremely obvious to others that I am likely a gamer. To the opposite effect, I enjoy listening to punk music, new wave, and classic rock, yet surprisingly I have no band shirts or fashion items for any of them (though I likely will at some point).</p>
            <p>What can you guys come up with? Can you integrate other social theories into your examples? Perhaps the social scripts your follow are an example of non-verbal performativity. It is interesting to see all of the different things we do and do not show about ourselves. I hope everybody reading this can come up with good examples in their own lives and that this can provide some introspection.</p>
