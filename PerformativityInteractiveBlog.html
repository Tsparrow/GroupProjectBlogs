            <p>Passing, the ability to be regarded as a member of an identity group or category (Wikipedia, 2021d), in this case different than their own. This has been used in many different ways throughout history. It’s versatility in preventing persecution and stigma has made it prevalent in most places where they were present. The diversity in types of passing also makes it an interesting subject to examine, as you can see how society has changed and yet remained the same over time. While I will be covering historical instances, many of the styles and types of passing continue to this day.</p>
            <p>One of the areas that we’ve uncovered more about over time is the many forms of sexual passing that have occurred. This is generally referred to as being “in the closet“, and can refer to many different sexual orientations and gender identities. Sometimes being in the closet is used by someone to avoid the legal ramifications of their sexuality, instead of the stigma which is common in some modern societies. Lavender weddings (marriages to conceal non-heterosexual activity) within Hollywood were once used to avoid morality clauses that prohibited them from being openly non-heterosexual (LGBT Info Wiki, n.d.). Most instances of this are essentially rumors since it is hard to say whether the commonly discussed marriages were entered for said intent. This is obviously a very minor issue in comparison to some other instances throughout history, but is an example that shows that marriages of convenience aren’t nonexistent within western culture.</p>
            <p>During the Nazi regime, the police would actively raid establishments catering to gay individuals, with over 100,000 people being arrested during Nazi regime, and somewhere between 5,000-15,000 men were estimated to have been sent to concentration camps (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2021b). Within these camps, they could be subjected medical experiments, assigned harsh labor, and eventually forcefully castrated (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2021b). The harsh punishments would be strong incentives to pass as straight within German society and avoid capture.</p>
            <p>Passing is multifaceted, and two of the other key areas of passing that also became important during WW2 were racial and religious passing. At the time of the Nazi regime, many Jewish people had integrated into society and adopted Christianity as well as dropping many of their Jewish traditions (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2019). Because of this, they struggled in finding ways to categorize the race in laws meant to further anti-Semitic goals (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2019). By successfully integrating into society, a lot of the people, who would go on to be classified as Jews, passed within society to the point where they could not easily be targeted. To address this, the Nuremberg Laws defined a Jew as any individual that had 3 or 4 grandparents born into the Jewish religious community (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2019). These laws meant that in order to pass you would have to start to build a new identity.</p>
            <p>Barbara Schieb, a historian, said when touching on the topic for a film related NPR article that for “Jews in Germany — where potentially everyone was a Nazi and there was no organized resistance — people had to hide in plain sight. They just said, I'm somebody else. They invented a new Aryan-sounding identity. And for this, they needed helpers. They needed a home, something to eat, money, of course — and they needed false documents. But they were visible. You see it in the film, how they are working, meeting. And yet they are invisible. It's the false identity that is visible" (Beardsley, 2019). Doing this successfully could be seen as the difference between life and death, as approximately two thirds of Europe’s prewar Jewish population were killed by the Nazis (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2021a).</p>
            <p>A version of religious passing also occurred in the Islamic world. In Shi’ite Islam a practice known as Taqiyya (though it goes by many name variants) has come into general acceptance where “a believing individual can deny his Islamic faith or commit otherwise illegal or blasphemous acts while they are at risk of significant persecution,” and it “is lawful in situations where there is overwhelming danger of loss of life or property and where no danger to religion would occur thereby” (WikiIslam, 2021). The reason why this is most commonly used by and associated with Shi’ites is due to them being a large minority sect within Islam which has faced persecution from non-Islamic faiths and the Sunni Majority (including being a defender during the First Crusade) (WikiIslam, 2021; Wikipedia 2021b). When used against non-Islamic religions this doctrine can be seen as a form of crypto-Islam (Wikipedia, 2021a), which is a form of crypto-religion. This is where someone secretly practices their faith (in this case Islam), while generally trying to appear like a member of a non-persecuted faith (Wikipedia, 2021a). This has similarly emerged in many other faiths (Wikipedia, 2021a), as most faiths have been persecuted somewhere at some time. It is just especially of note within Shia Islam as it is accepted doctrine, which is seemingly uncommon.</p>
            <p>To continue on the racial passing lines that were mentioned previously, we will move forward to one of the most relevant historical areas in U.S. history today, the Antebellum to Civil-Rights era persecution and passing of “blacks”. The use of the term “blacks” with quotes is very important, as this term did not only apply to people with black skin or African heritage, this sometimes was simply applied as a term against races that were just considered impure compared to the white European races, though this final sense of the term is likely not applicable after a certain period. It also is not a particularly humanizing term as it removes the “person” and reduces them to their skin color, but this is how the social caste that emerged was identified historically. </p>
            <p>This expanded sense can be seen in 1921 when the Arkansas supreme court deemed that a woman who was by all appearances, with a small amount of Cherokee ancestry, was “black” (Sweet, 2020). This was because Arkansas had one of, if not the strictest definition of the legal term “Negro”, where having any “Negro blood” would make you fall under it (Sweet, 2020). Previously, and in most other states, a fractional or more loosely defined system was used where a certain fraction or a jury would decide your legal race, sometimes factoring in appearance (Sweet, 2020). </p>
            <p>For instance, in the case of Guy v. Daniel (in January 1861 nearing the end of the Antebellum era), there was a small amount of evidence that would suggest that Abby Guy was a slave who had been treated as a non-slave, so Daniel tried to take her and her family as his slaves (Butler, 2020). This went to a court case in which the Guy family was decided to be white based on their behavior within society and appearances (Butler, 2020). While it is hard to say, Abby Guy may have had an African lineage and therefore have successfully passed as white despite not meeting the legal definition. Similarly, mixed race slaves born on plantations would often try to escape and pass as white individuals, though would. </p>
            <p>In the eras after US Civil the war following the Post-Emancipation era, we still saw the influences of White Supremacy ideology on society, with groups like the Ku Klux Klan forming and segregation being enforced (Wikipedia, 2021c; Honeymon, 2014). These groups committed atrocities against African-Americans and thus exacerbated the continuing need for passing within American society that already existed because of the unequal status imposed by segregation laws. It is claimed that 3,446 African Americans were lynched from 1882 to 1962 (Johnson, 2020).</p>
            <p>This resulted in some interesting forms of passing that became necessary to resist the violence and injustice presented by the KKK. Walter F. White, the eventual executive secretary of the NAACP, was classified as 5/32 black and raised in an African American community, but had mostly “white” features, including fair skin, blue eyes, and so on (Whitaker, 2007). Because of this, he was able to pass extremely well. He ended up successfully infiltrating the KKK and documented the murders of at least 40 individuals (Whitaker, 2007). This case of passing allowed him to avoid the prejudices of the people around him, despite his cultural background, even when surrounded by some of the most prejudiced individuals in that society.</p>
            <p>Passing has been prevalent throughout history, and frankly I was only able to graze on some significant instances of passing. These are also examples that are largely in countries where the norms have changed in the modern day to be less extreme. In general, passing has been an important tool of the oppressed. This has led to it having played an important role in shaping our history and being found in too many places to ever fully describe. Passing is engrained into our society, for the better or worse.</p>
